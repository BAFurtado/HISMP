### Heterogeneity and Instability in the Stable Marriage Problem

This is the repository that generalizes the SMP to different group size as in Shi et al. 2018. 
Additionally it includes the possibility that members from both groups become active message senders.

Plese, refer to (and cite) the preprint available at arXiv (submitted):
#### Furtado, Bernardo Alves. (2019) Heterogeneity and Instability in the Stable Marriage Problem
https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09226

#### Running

If you run 
#### `python repeat.py <number of repetitions> <number of cores>` 
you can get all the program to run, 
saving the data and producing the plots.

Make sure to have created a `saved_data` directory and an `outputs` one.
